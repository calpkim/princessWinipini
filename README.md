# Princess Winipini Code Project
## This code is to accompany a boat we have constructed and to connect it with Radio using wifi Arduino ESPs. Our hope is to make a complete remote control boat/device with a multi-functional remote and an elaborate system in the boat.
### Coded with the Arduino Variant of C++
